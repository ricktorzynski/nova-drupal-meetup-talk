# Practical Application of AI Chatbots in Drupal
# Presented at Northern Virginia Drupal Meetup Group
# January 18, 2022 7-9pm

Chatbots are a type of computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and respond to spoken or written language, which can be programmed to reply to simple keywords or hold intricate conversations about specific domains of knowledge. Since their implementation, chatbots have been reported to save as much as 30% in customer service costs. While they are increasingly ubiquitous, chatbots still must be delicately programmed as to provide the best user-flow to prevent recursive conversation, frustrated clicks, and keyboard smashing.

In this presentation, you'll learn how to integrate practical applications of conversational AI chatbots into your Drupal site using Rasa, an open source chatbot framework, and the Component module. Due to Drupal open-source nature and the modules available, Drupal provides a wealth of opportunities to develop an elegant, user-friendly chatbot for your site.

Some of the topics covered will include:
- A gentle introduction to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
- How conversational AI chatbots work
- How to develop a knowledge/conversation base
- Brief discussion of the different chatbots available
- An overview of Rasa, an open source conversational AI chatbot framework
- How to add a Rasa chatbot to a Drupal website
- How to continually improve a chatbot through Conversation Driven Development
